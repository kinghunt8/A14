<h2>What are cookies and how are they used?</h2>
<p>In short, cookies are little memory packets that are sent between web servers, and are stored in your computer's hardware. When you revisit the site you chose for example, your web browser will send the cookies back to the web server so you can start where you left off, or ads are shown for what you have viewed and many other cases. As stated by kb.iu “These files typically contain information about your visit to the web page, as well as any information you've volunteered, such as your name and interests.”
    But, is this a security concern, or is this ethical. Cookies do not track personal data, just maybe your name if you fill out any forms, and of course websites you visited. On top of that, you can disable cookie tracking if you feel the need to do so. After evaluation, cookies are ethical as you can disable them and they do not truly track your information, just what you visit, which is public domain anyway.
    Cookies are a great way to have convenience for websites you previously visited. Also, although this may be a con for a consumer, you can get ads personalized to you and what you like, rather than an ad on something random you hate, maybe washing machines for example. However, there are some cons, this being privacy concerns, and security. You can always disable cookies but security was an issue just a few years back from holes in the system. In conclusion cookies are a good way to have convenience when on web browsing, but can have some annoyances.
